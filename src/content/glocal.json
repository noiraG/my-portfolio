  "overview": "In order to make their vision into a reality, me and my team members were brought in by a group of graduate students to help develop their Capstone Project.\n\nThey wanted to create a mobile travel companion that was unlike any other in the market. \n\nOn top of being a tool for travel research and itinerary planning, Glocal was also designed to act as a social media platform like pinterest, and Instagram. Users without immediate travel plans can also use the app to browse through interesting sights and hidden gems and saving them to their collection. ",
  "process": "My team was brought in at a very early phase of the project where many details and features of the app were not fully flushed out. We therefore not only implemented the software portion of the project but were also consulted on what features we thought were most scalable and valueable to users.\n\nOver the course of the 3 months working on this project, we switched directions a few times based on feedback received during user testing. It went from being an itinerary planning application to something resembling a social media platform, before settling on our final concept that was a combination of both.\n\nI also worked closely with the resident UX designer on the client's team to implement the application and test the app with some users.\n",
  "platform": "We built this app on Expo with React Native as we wanted to be able to iterate quickly and give our clients access to the deployed version for user testing. Expo also allowed our App to be deployed on both iOS and Andriod devices.\n"
